In the following [link](https://www.loom.com/share/eb9df83f56b8498487a25c83e2c89b27) I am explaining the capstone project.

## Built With
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- Lighthouse (An open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. It has audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO and more).
- Webhint (A customizable linting tool that helps you improve your site's accessibility, speed, cross-browser compatibility, and more by checking your code for best practices and common errors).

- ESLint

### Prerequisites
The basic requirements for building the executable are:
* A working browser application (Google chrome, Mozilla Fire fox, Microsoft edge ...)
* VSCode or any other equivalent code editor
* Node Package Manager (For installing packages like Lighthous, webhint & stylelint used for checking for debugging bad codes before deployment)
